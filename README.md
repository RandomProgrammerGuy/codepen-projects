# codepen-projects
This repository hosts the sorce code for every project I've uploaded to CodePen. Yes, you can view everything on CodePen as well, but this is a compilation of all the projects in one place, in case someone finds such a thing useful

## typewriter-effect
This is a css-only animation that mimicks the effect of one typing on a computer keyboard, complete with a blinking cursor and everything. Note that the code is based off of Kevin Powell's YouTube video on this project, but it includes customized sections not included in Powell's code

## modern-searchbar
A simple, elegant search bar that can be easily integrated into your website. It shrinks when not in use but expands to full width when needed. Although I decided not to have a search button, it can be very easily integrated with either an external icon library such as Font Awesome or Bootstrap Icons, or with a locally hosted image.
