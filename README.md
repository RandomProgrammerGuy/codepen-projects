# codepen-projects
This repository hosts the sorce code for every project I've uploaded to CodePen. Yes, you can view everything on CodePen as well, but this is a compilation of all the projects in one place, in case someone finds such a thing useful

## typewriter-effect
This is a css-only animation that mimicks the effect of one typing on a computer keyboard, complete with a blinking cursor and everything. Note that the code is based off of Kevin Powell's YouTube video on this project, but it includes customized sections not included in Powell's code
